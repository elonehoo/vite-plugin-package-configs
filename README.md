# vite-plugin-package-configs

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vite-plugin-package-configs?color=a1b858&label=)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-package-configs)

Extend Vite config from your package.json `vite` field.

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "vite": {
    "resolve": {
      "alias": {
        "~/": "src/"
      }
    },
    "build": {
      "output": "dist/"
    }
  }
}
```

## Install

```bash
npm i -D vite-plugin-package-configs
```

Add plugin to your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import PKG from 'vite-plugin-package-configs'

export default {
  plugins: [
    PKG()
  ]
}
```

## why

Well, I know you can always have those configurations in your `vite.config.ts` file. But, aware the file is in JavaScript / TypeScript, it is not that friendly to be statically analyzed. By putting some of the static configurations in your `package.json` file, you can have it shareable for other scripts and tools (or even manipulate it) by simply loading and parsing the JSON file.
